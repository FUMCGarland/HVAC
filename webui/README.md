# FUMCG HVAC Web User Interface aka the Joyous Online Scheduler for HVAC (JOSH)

This is the GUI for the HVAC system. It talks to the REST module in the controller process. It is written in sveltekit. If you know Javascript, you should be able to work in it. Sveltekit has a built-in router and a clean syntax.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
